Ironman 4x4 Suspension was the first company in the world to recognise the importance of greasable shackles and pin kits. The reason for the introduction of greasable kits was that polyurethane bushes will provide extra long life if they are greased. Ironman shackle and pin kits are perfectly matched to be fitted with Ironman polyurethane bushes and come complete with protected grease nipples, recessed nuts and washers. To enhance appearance and make them rust resistant, Ironman greasable shackle and pin kits have been zinc rich coated.', notes:'', specifications_attributes:[{title:'Package Details', value:'Each'}, {title:'Price Per Vehicle', value:'40'}], price:'22') if not '387-1'.blank?;	vehicle189 = Refinery::Ironman::Vehicle.find_by_name('KB-TFS 1988-03/2003');	product189.vehicles << vehicle189 if vehicle189.present? and product189.present?;	category189 = Refinery::Ironman::Category.find_by_name('Shackles & Pins');	product189.categories << category189 if category189.present? and product189.present?

Exceptional performance for both standard and raised height 4x4’s & superior ride control and comfort both on and off road is what you can expect from these shock absorbers. The shocks, designed by Ironman 4x4 suspension engineers, have been individually made component by component to produce the world’s finest offroad shock absorber. Each and every Ironman shock absorber is force velocity tested before packaging to ensure all parts received are uniform and within operating specification. High quality materials such as German Fuchs High temp shock absorber fluid, Japanese NOK multilip seals are used. Strength and durability requirements are sorted by the use of re-enforced single piece eye rings and stems. Rubber shock absorber bushes are used by Ironman, this is to promote maximum flexibility and reduction in unwanted side load and NVH (Noise Vibration Harshness) transmission which often causes seal failures in other brand shock absorbers using Polyurethane.', notes:'', specifications_attributes:[{title:'Package Details', value:'Each'}, {title:'Price Per Vehicle', value:'280'}], price:'154') if not '24667FE'.blank?;	vehicle1054 = Refinery::Ironman::Vehicle.find_by_name('L400 1994+');	product1054.vehicles << vehicle1054 if vehicle1054.present? and product1054.present?;	category1054 = Refinery::Ironman::Category.find_by_name('Shock Absorbers');	product1054.categories << category1054 if category1054.present? and product1054.present?

Ironman Nitro Gas Shocks provide exceptional performance for both standard and raised height 4x4’s whilst delivering superior ride control and comfort both on and off road. Improve stability when towing or carrying a load. Each and every Ironman shock absorber is force velocity tested before packaging to ensure all parts received are uniform and within operating specification. High quality materials such as German Fuchs High temp shock absorber fluid, Japanese NOK multilip seals are used. Strength and durability requirements are sorted by the use of re-enforced single piece eye rings and stems. Rubber shock absorber bushes are used by Ironman, this is to promote maximum flexibility and reduction in unwanted side load and NVH (Noise Vibration Harshness) transmission which often causes seal failures in other brand shock absorbers using Polyurethane.', notes:'Extra Long Travel|||Rear brake hose bracket may require slight modification with extra long travel shock absorbers|||', specifications_attributes:[{title:'Package Details', value:'Each'}, {title:'Price Per Vehicle', value:'200'}], price:'110') if not '12081GR'.blank?;	vehicle2052 = Refinery::Ironman::Vehicle.find_by_name('2005+');	product2052.vehicles << vehicle2052 if vehicle2052.present? and product2052.present?;	category2052 = Refinery::Ironman::Category.find_by_name('Shock Absorbers');	product2052.categories << category2052 if category2052.present? and product2052.present?
